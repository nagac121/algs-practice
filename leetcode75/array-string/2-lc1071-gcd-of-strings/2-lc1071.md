# GCD of strings

## PROBLEM:

1071: Greatest Common Divisor of Strings  
<https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/>  
difficulty = "Easy"

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t
(i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

## Example 1

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"  
Output: "ABC"

## Example 2

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"  
Output: "AB"

## Example 3

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"  
Output: ""

## Constraints

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000  
str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.

## APPROACH 1 VS APPROACH 2

That's a great comparison question — and both approaches are solid, but the one you should **use in a coding interview** depends on the **interview's expectations**: do they want **clarity + reasoning** or **cleverness + brevity**?

Let’s break them down clearly:

---

### ✅ **Approach 1: Brute-force with validation**

```python
# Checks every possible prefix from longest to shortest
# Validates by checking if the prefix repeats correctly
```

#### Pros

* Very **clear and explainable**
* Demonstrates understanding of **string repetition logic**
* Interviewer can see **your thought process**
* Easy to write and debug live

#### Cons:

* Slightly more code
* A bit less efficient (still O(n), though)

---

### ✅ **Approach 2: Elegant + Math-based (using GCD of lengths)**

```python
# Uses math.gcd + string concatenation property
```

#### Pros of approach 2

* Very **short and efficient**
* Elegant if the interviewer knows the trick
* Shows knowledge of **mathematical patterns**

#### Cons of approach 2

* May **look like a "black box"** if you don't explain it well
* Some interviewers may expect you to **derive the idea**, not just recall it

### 🎯 **Which one should you use in interviews?**

| Situation                          | Best Approach                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Explaining from scratch            | ✅ **Approach 1**                                       |
| Follow-up optimization asked       | ✅ Start with 1, then mention 2                         |
| Time-limited or advanced interview | ✅ Use **Approach 2**, but explain clearly why it works |

---

### 🔁 Ideal flow in an interview:

1. ✅ **Start with Approach 1** — show your logic and validate the idea manually.

2. 🔄 If the interviewer wants optimization:

   > “We can also solve this more efficiently by noticing that the true GCD string must repeat to form both original strings. So we can use `math.gcd()` on the lengths and check the concatenation trick…”

3. ✅ Then write Approach 2.

---

### 🧠 Final Tip

* Always **explain why** you’re choosing a particular method.
* **Clarity > cleverness**, unless they explicitly ask for it.
